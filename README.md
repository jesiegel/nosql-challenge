# nosql-challenge
For this challenge, I used the libraries PyMongo and pprint to import and analyze data in a json file. I updated the databse by adding an additional restaurant and updating the data types of various variables.

In the analysis section, I answered the following questions:
1. Which establishments have a hygiene score equal to 20?
2. Which establishments in London have a RatingValue greater than or equal to 4?
3. What are the top 5 establishments with a RatingValue of 5, sorted by lowest hygiene score, nearest to the new restaurant added, "Penang Flavours"?
4. How many establishments in each Local Authority area have a hygiene score of 0?
5.
